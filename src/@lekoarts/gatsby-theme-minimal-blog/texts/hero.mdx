I'm Edro. You can remember it easily if you think of it as "Pedro" without the "P". This is a trick
that has not failed me yet so far in my introductions to people.

Prior to going into my Computer Systems Technology diploma at BCIT. I was professional dancer. I had
up to at one point lead, trained, and choreographed for 20+ other dancers. I love dance and still
dance to this day but something I have always enjoyed is technology. As a 7 year old kid, I still
remember being the family's earliest adopter of computers and was essentially the family's IT guy growing up. In
2022, I had decided to pivot from my business school education at SFU to try my hand in the
technology sector with a focus on Web Development. The culmination of my experience as a dancer and
also coming from a business background made it so that I was able to land my first role as a Junior
Software Developer doing React front-end for a startup company that did contract work for a large
real estate builder in Canada. 

It was from this experience, I learned the joys and pains of software development but it solidifed
my decision to fully invest into the tech sector. Now that I am in BCIT having come from a co-op
doing IT, I would love the opportunity to discuss and chat with more people not only in the industry but also in
a similar road map to me to further the discussions of the use of tech in their daily life and
career.
