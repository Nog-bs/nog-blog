Asking "good questions" is a skill that will undoubtedly benefit you at CST, but its value extends far beyond the program. In fact, it's a crucial skill for any engineer, or anyone, really. Mastering the art of asking good questions can significantly impact your career and how others perceive you.

## I Don't Believe in Stupid People, Just Stupid Questions

I firmly believe that people aren't inherently stupid; they simply ask poorly thought-out questions or don't ask enough questions. This is partly tied to curiosity. Growing up, I had many distractions that often led me to take the easy path. If it weren't for some influential people in my life, like my intermediate at one of my internships and my manager from a sales job, I might lack the self-drive and the desire to ask the right questions that I have today.

An example of where I learned the importance of asking good questions was during my developer internship. One thing you don't want to do, especially in an engineering/development internship, is ask the same question repeatedly. When you ask a question, your goal should be to finalize whatever insight or pathway in your brain needs that final piece. That final piece is crucial because you've already done the work to reach that point; you just need that final push from someone knowledgeable, like a colleague or your manager, to get you to the next stage. While this is simple in theory, I think it's quite challenging in practice, especially for those with an ego.

I believe that if you're smart, you should have an ego. It's okay not to have unwavering self-confidence, but most intelligent people I've interacted with have an ego driven by their accomplishments. I taught myself most of my React skills and landed an internship without a degree. I memorized up to 120 digits of Pi. In CST, I had nearly 100% for a few of my subjects. Writing this out, I realize I have a considerable ego. And while this ego opens many doors, it also hinders my growth by preventing me from asking questions out of fear of seeming stupid or incompetent.

If you're not asking enough good questions, you're likely already falling into that territory. It's the hard truth, but it's factual. If you're reading this, you're probably a student or a junior seeking insights on how to advance your career. This implies you don't have any or little experience in the field and that is ok! We all start somewhere and while there are kids as young as 12 already getting offers from FAANG (I don't know if this is true to be honest haha) but their doings do not affect your chances so long as you keep moving forward and you seek to fill in your knowledge gaps with good questions.

So, what constitutes a good question? There was this one time in term 1 of CST where we had to submit labs every week for a programming class. These labs always required us to include our student number and full name at the top of our code. This teacher was very particular and would deduct marks for missed details like this. He had many requirements for his assignments, so you had to be extremely attentive. This class was also heavily weighted, making it crucial for anyone wanting to compete for co-op.

Mid-semester, the teacher suddenly announced that ALL pieces of our code, including multiple files and testing files (which could be 10-20 files per assignment), needed our name and student number. This felt redundant and time-consuming, especially when balancing 6-7 other labs/assignments and studying for quizzes. Everyone was frustrated.

That's when THE QUESTION arose: "Why are we doing this? Why do we need to put a name and student number on every single file?" I was stressed because I'd seen classmates lose marks over seemingly minor things, and I was afraid I was next. So, I asked in a Slack channel with my classmates and teacher why we were being asked to do this, and I also left a frank comment about the redundancy of this new requirement. This led to a tumultuous exchange with the teacher.

He messaged me, calling me rude and stating that my tone/manner was unacceptable. His message was quite serious, and I was genuinely scared. While I agreed that I was rude, I also wanted to emphasize that asking for something new mid-semester, when we had a solid process in place, was causing stress for many students. Eventually, the teacher and I reached a consensus. It was a redundant requirement, but he emphasized that I had been rude, which I accepted.

The end result was that the teacher removed the requirement and had a long conversation with me about my tone when asking questions. When my classmates recall this incident in a funny jest, they usually focus on the fact I never backed down or that I had the guts to argue with the teacher. However, the most important takeaway for me looking back was the confidence in the question I asked. The aspect where I said the process was redundant isn't the important part as that was just me having the guts to be frank which is not helpful. The crucial part of this scenario was when I asked, "Why are we doing this process when we already do such and such?" It's a question that doesn't disagree but seeks to understand why we're doing something that feels illogical or simply just wastes everyones time. It's not the teacher or the student who is stupid in this matter, but the process.

As an engineer, you'll want to question things or processes you encounter. Sometimes, the answer to why something is not "clean" or is redundant is simply that someone was too lazy to fix it. These questions lead to opportunities. To follow-up on the aftermath I had with that teacher, not only did we see eye to eye on the issue but in other conversations he has also offered to provide me referrals for quite large companies. He also helped me in acquiring some equipment that I need as I am currently working bit by bit on a startup. Another scenario that I ought to mention regarding questions is when I asked my manager at my co-op why we didn't have documentation for certain process. He basically said that since it was just him for the past three years, there was no need, and he was too lazy to write or update any documentation. I took the initiative to own the IT documentation and wrote over 200 pages, which I know will benefit other staff and myself.

Learning to ask good questions will undoubtedly benefit your career. It may even save your grades, as it has mine many times. Asking that "stupid" question can lead you somewhere, and you should have confidence in your "stupidity." Understanding that you don't know everything is key, and it will lead you to ask good questions that even your manager and colleagues will appreciate. The moment people start saying, "Wow, that's a good question," your career prospects will change, and you'll be seen as highly competent. However, don't forget that behind the question you are asking there needs to be a follow up as there is a reason why you are asking it in the first place. Going forward, hopefully you have motivation now to ask those very important questions whether it's in class or at work.

## Final Thoughts

I hope this blog post provides some insights into my journey and the value of asking good questions. Please feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edrogonzales/). Maybe I will set up a feedback form but who knows where this blog will go. I could be just blogging into the nether for all I know. If you join me on this journey, let's start a conversation ðŸ˜ƒ
