Hi there! This is my first entry documenting my journey as a Computer Systems Technology (CST) student at BCIT. I've had many experiences before arriving here, but my goal for this blog is twofold: to provide a space for personal reflection and to potentially offer insights to other students considering or currently enrolled in the CST program. I'm just a student sharing my perspective, not an official representative of the institution.

## Why CST?

One key distinction between BCIT's CST program and computer science programs at SFU or UBC is its intensity. You'll likely do more coding in your first three months at BCIT than most senior UBC students do in their entire program. This doesn't mean those programs are inferior, just that BCIT prioritizes hands-on experience. This two-year program serves as a fast-track to a computer science education, equipping graduates with practical skills.

That said, this program isn't for everyone. If you prefer a more traditional path and don't mind a 4-6 year commitment, SFU or UBC might be better suited for you. They offer degrees, which, in hindsight, I wish I had pursued. In the current tech landscape, a diploma may not be as impressive. Nevertheless, I'm happy to be at BCIT working towards this diploma, which is still highly competitive. Many employers in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland value, and even prefer, BCIT grads for our hands-on approach.

My decision to attend BCIT was influenced by my unique circumstances:

I was already working full-time as a software developer.
I was a bootcamp graduate who was largely self-taught.
I lacked formal post-secondary education, having only attended Beedie School of Business for almost two years.
I wanted a quick and efficient way to obtain a recognized credential; a 4-6 year degree didn't seem worthwhile to me at the time.
These were my personal considerations, and they may not resonate with everyone. Other personal factors also played a role, but I'll keep those private for now to maintain a higher-level focus for this blog. Who knows, I might delve into more personal details later if it feels right. For now, let's discuss how things are going in the CST program.

## How It's Going at CST

Currently, I'm in the middle of my co-op term, working as a Junior IT Systems Administrator at a medium-sized non-profit. This wasn't my initial planâ€”I applied out of desperation near the co-op deadline. However, it has turned out to be an incredibly eye-opening experience that has significantly shifted my career aspirations. I'll elaborate on that later, but for now, let's focus on my current experience in the CST program.

Despite my past struggles with traditional schooling, I'm thriving in CST. I've never been a natural high-achiever, often doing the bare minimum to pass. CST, however, has pushed me to my limits. I've had to become proactive, make new friends, and dedicate myself to studyingâ€”sometimes from 9 am to 10 pm almost every weekday. It has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life.

It's important to note that this isn't everyone's CST experience. Success in this program, especially if you're aiming for co-op and genuine learning, demands discipline. This principle applies to any endeavor, not just CST.

I've formed many valuable connections during my time in the program, both with fellow students and faculty members. Coming from a bootcamp/self-taught background, I've had to acquire most of my industry skills independently. However, this didn't make CST any easier. While my prior experience made web development courses relatively straightforward, the program challenged me in other areas, such as discrete mathematics and computer architecture. Although these subjects might not be directly applicable to every job, I recognized they were gaps in my foundational knowledge as a software developer.

This reflection reminds me of a past conversation with my intermediate at my previous job:

I was tasked with developing a feature that involved extensive conditional logic. Due to the nuanced requirements, using a switch case wasn't feasible. During a code review, my intermediate suggested using logic tables. At the time, I was unfamiliar with both logic tables and Boolean math, so the explanation went completely over my head. Looking back, I see this as a clear indication of my lack of foundational knowledge. Concepts like discrete math and Boolean algebra can significantly impact the optimization of conditional logic, which was certainly the case for me during that internship.

While my code wasn't necessarily bad, it could have been more efficient with a stronger foundation. This realization reinforces my appreciation for being in school now, learning these essential skills. I'm confident that this knowledge will be invaluable when I re-enter the workforce. If I were to take on a similar junior role again, I know I would not only excel but also have the confidence to explore new opportunities.

## Final Thoughts

I hope this blog post provides some insights into my journey and the value of formal education. Please feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edrogonzales/). Maybe I will set up a feedback form but who knows where this blog will go. I could be just blogging into the nether for all I know. If you join me on this journey, let's start a conversation ðŸ˜ƒ
