Hi, this is my first note regarding my journey as a Computer Systems Technology (CST) student at BCIT. I have done a lot of things prior going into the British Columbia Institute of Technology but my goal for this blog is to not only allow me to be able to look back and reflect on my learnings but also maybe help other students who are planning to go into the CST program or even current students. I do not whatsoever represent the institution, I am merely a student üßë‚Äçüéì

## Why CST?

One thing that I learned when in BCIT and comparing my experiences to grads from SFU or UBC is how intense the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program at BCIT is. In the first three months of the program you probably do more coding than the course load of most senior UBC students. This is not to say those programs are lesser, it's just a fact that BCIT is suppper focussed on the hands-on aspects of this program. This program stretches two years and servers to speed-run a computer science education all while giving grads a skillset of being hands-on.

I would say this program is not for everyone. If you want a more secure but do not mind a 4-6 year journey, go for either SFU or UBC. Those two schools at the end of the day provide degrees which I now in my wisdom wish I could acquire as I feel now a diploma is not super impressive in the tech landscape. Nonetheless, I am happy to be at BCIT and working towards this diploma. This diploma is still competitive and many employers in Vancouver or the lower mainland like and to some extent prefer BCIT grads as we will have a hands-on mindset when it comes to roles. Do not take this post as a big "this institution is better so therefore go here...", everyone's life circumstances are different. Here were mine in the beginning:

-   I was a working full-time Software Developer previously
-   I had been a bootcamp grad that self-taught themselves into the field
-   I did not have a proper post-secondary education other than being in Beedie School of Business for almost 2 years
-   I wanted a quick and easy way to get a VALID education ie. 4-6 year degree was not worth it from my perspective back then

These were my circumstances and thoughts going into the program and they are not a reflection of everyone. There were also some other personal reasons but I will say the bare minimum as a way to start this blog on a more higher-level note. Who knows, maybe I'll go into some personal stuff. I do want to make this a little bit personal depending on how I think this blog works for me.

So maybe let's talk about how it's going right now at CST.

## How it's going @ CST

Currently I am in co-op. I am a Junior IT Systems Administrator role at a medium-sized non-profit. I was not expecting to enter into an IT role and I initially applied out of being desperate for a co-op role as I was nearing a deadline. Little did I know, this has been a really perspective-changing experience. I can talk more about how this has shifted my career but to go back onto how it's going right now. I think CST has been super great. Personally for me I have struggled with school. I have never been a top student or one of the top students, I always did the minimum to pass. At CST, I really pushed these parts of myself to the max. I was very pro-active. I made friends. I would do schooling from 9 am all the way to 10 pm including study time almost every weekday. This program has been one of the hardest experiences but also rewarding. This is not to say that in CST, this experience is like this for everyone, but if you want to get into co-op and also LEARN, you need to be disciplined. I think that's just a simple fact for anything, not just in CST.
